Game simulating the daily life of fishermen

This project was created as an attempt to help students understand concepts of financial planning and risk undertaking.
By playing as fishermen, they have to decide how to allocate their money to buy equipments needed for work 
at the same time they guarantee their daily needs. By balancing the skills they learn with the risks
of the many possible journeys, they can improve their earnings, and save money to pay for lost boats or nets.
